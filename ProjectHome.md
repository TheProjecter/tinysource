tinySource is a small series of Python CGI scripts for the management of software projects and source code files. It is intended for individuals and organizations that need simple source control without having to implement or learn more complex CVS systems.

Currently tinySource is written for Microsoft's IIS and requires Microsoft SQL. A port to Linux/MySQL is planned.
